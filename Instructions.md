# open the project and go to Game -> Free Aspect -> choose 1:1 Aspect
we changed the input system to the new input system.
we added a new mechanic that the invaders throw randomly stars and the player needs to collect them 
in addition, we used a new UI that counts the collected stars(each star = 100 points).
